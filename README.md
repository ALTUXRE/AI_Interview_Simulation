## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Python:** Version 3.9 or newer.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
* **FFmpeg:** This is a crucial dependency for OpenAI's Whisper to process audio.
    * **Windows (using Chocolatey):**
        ```bash
        choco install ffmpeg
        ```
    * **macOS (using Homebrew):**
        ```bash
        brew install ffmpeg
        ```
    * **Debian/Ubuntu Linux:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
        ```

### 2. Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal and clone the project repository.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

3.  **Install All Required Packages**
    This single command will install everything listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Configuration: Setting Up the API Key

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function.

1.  **Get your API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  **Create a file** named `.env` in the root of your project folder.
3.  **Add your key** to the `.env` file in the following format:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Your API key is a secret. Never share the `.env` file or commit it to a public GitHub repository. The included `.gitignore` file should prevent this, but always be careful.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application

With the setup complete, you can now launch the application.

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is active.** (You should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt).
2.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3.  Your default web browser will automatically open a new tab with the ProVoice AI application running.

## ü§î Troubleshooting

* **Error: "Could not understand audio" or Whisper fails.**
    * Ensure you are in a quiet environment.
    * Speak clearly and directly into your microphone.
    * Verify that **FFmpeg** was installed correctly on your system.
* **Microphone not working.**
    * Make sure you clicked "Allow" when the browser asked for microphone permissions.
    * Check your browser's site settings to ensure `localhost` is not blocked from accessing your microphone.
    * Check your operating system's privacy settings for microphone access.
* **Error: `ModuleNotFoundError`**
    * This means a required package is missing. Make sure you have activated your virtual environment (`venv`) correctly before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
